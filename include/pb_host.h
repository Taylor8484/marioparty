/*
 * PartyBoard host-port types (https://github.com/Taylor8484/partyboard4, games/mp1).
 *
 * Every type here expands to the exact original N64 type when TARGET_PC is undefined, so the
 * matching build is unchanged by construction. On the host (TARGET_PC, LP64/LLP64) they widen
 * integers that the game uses to hold addresses.
 *
 *   PB_PTR32   s32 on N64, intptr_t on the host: a signed 32-bit integer that holds a pointer.
 *   PB_UPTR32  u32 on N64, uintptr_t on the host: the unsigned counterpart.
 *   PB_ROM_ADDR(a)  host only: a ROM offset that the N64 links as a symbol (see below).
 *   PB_N64_ADDR(T, a)  an N64 address kept as data that the host never dereferences (the
 *              overlay segment table): ((T)(a)) on N64, through uintptr_t on the host.
 *   PB_N64_RAM(a, s)  a fixed N64 RAM region the game uses as a buffer (heaps at 0x80120000...):
 *              (void *)(a) on N64; on the host a zeroed block of PB_N64_RAM_SIZE(s) = 2 * s bytes
 *              (host structures are wider), the same block for the same address every time.
 *   PB_HOSTCAST(T, x)  ((T)(x)) on the host, (x) on N64: a conversion the N64 code performs
 *              implicitly (an int passed where a pointer is expected, or back), made explicit
 *              for the host only.
